#   SQL Queries and Databse Interaction
#  - Flight Retrieval: Retrieve flights based on multiple criteria, such as destination, status, or departure date.
#  - Schedule Modification: Update flight schedules (e.g., change departure time or status).
#  - Pilot Assignment: Assign pilots to flights and retrieve information about pilot schedules.
#  - Destination Management: View and update destination information as required.
#  - Include additional queries that summarise data, such as the number of flights to each destination or the
#   number of flights assigned to a pilot

#   Application Development in Python (using SQLite3)
#  - Develop a command-line interface (CLI) in Python using the sqlite3 library to interact with your SQLite
#    database.
#  - The application should present a menu with options such as:
#     - Add a New Flight
#     - View Flights by Criteria
#     - Update Flight Information
#     - Assign Pilot to Flight
#     - View Pilot Schedule
#     - View/Update Destination Information
#     - Ensure the interface displays results clearly and allows users to make changes based on input.
